Bikeshare Trip Analysis Notes
- Created a mock dataset with 10 trips to simulate Lyft bikeshare data.
- Focused on queries relevant to urban mobility (duration, revenue, long trips).
- Optimized the revenue query using GROUP BY for monthly aggregation.
- Plan to expand with JOINs for multi-table analysis in the future.
