# Bikeshare Trip Analysis

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of mock bikeshare trip data, designed to provide actionable insights for urban mobility optimization. The project was developed independently as part of my portfolio for data analyst internships, showcasing skills in SQL, data analytics, and process development.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Analyze bikeshare trip data to calculate key metrics such as average trip duration, top riders, monthly revenue, and long-duration trips for operational review.
- **Tools**: SQLite, SQL queries.
- **Date**: September 2025.

## Files
- `bikeshare_trips.sql`: Contains the table schema, sample data, and SQL queries.
- `analysis_notes.txt` (optional): Brief notes on insights or methodology (e.g., how you optimized queries).

## SQL Analysis
- Calculated average trip duration per start location to identify usage patterns.
- Identified top 5 riders by trip count for loyalty insights.
- Computed total revenue by month to support financial planning.
- Flagged trips over 30 minutes for potential operational adjustments.

## How to Run
1. Install SQLite (e.g., via DB Browser for SQLite or command line).
2. Load `bikeshare_trips.sql` into SQLite.
3. Execute the queries to replicate the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset with more variables (e.g., bike type, weather).
- Integrate with a visualization tool (e.g., Tableau) for dashboards.
